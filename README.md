# hackathon2021
Project notes for the May 2021 NMinD hackathon. The big-picture and overview is managed as a [GitHub project](https://github.com/orgs/nmind/projects/1).

### Adding a project
Projects are managed as a set of [Issue Labels](https://github.com/nmind/hackathon2021/labels).

If you want to add a project, simply create a label of the form `project: <your-project-in-a-couple-words>`.

### Adding tasks or notes
Tasks are managed as [Issues](https://github.com/nmind/hackathon2021/issues).

To add a task, simply open an issue and apply the label for the appropriate project. It's encouraged to also add labels
such as `question`, `help wanted`, or `good first issue`, so others know where to jump in.

### Participationg
Meetings will largely take place via Zoom and Gathertown. Chat will take place on [Mattermost](http://mattermost.brainhack.org/) in the `#NMinD` channel. Links to the video conferencing will be shared separately via email and Mattermost.
